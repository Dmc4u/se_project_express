# WTWR (What to Wear?) â€” Back End

## Project Overview

**WTWR (What to Wear?)** is the back-end server for a weather-based clothing recommendation application.

This project focuses on:

- Building a secure and scalable **Node.js** server with **Express**.
- Managing **user authentication** and **authorization** using **JWT**.
- Implementing **CRUD operations** for clothing items.
- Connecting to a **MongoDB** database using **Mongoose**.
- Applying best practices for **validation**, **error handling**, and **security**.
- Deploying the API on a remote server with **PM2** for process management and crash recovery.

The goal is to provide an API that allows users to **register**, **log in**, **manage their wardrobe**, and **get clothing recommendations** based on the weather.
