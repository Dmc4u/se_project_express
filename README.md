# WTWR (What to Wear?) ‚Äî Back End

## üìö Project Overview

**WTWR (What to Wear?)** is the back-end server for a weather-based clothing recommendation application.

This project focuses on:

- Building a secure and scalable **Node.js** server with **Express**.
- Managing **user authentication** and **authorization** using **JWT**.
- Implementing **CRUD operations** for clothing items.
- Connecting to a **MongoDB** database using **Mongoose**.
- Applying best practices for **validation**, **error handling**, **security headers**, and **rate limiting**.
- Deploying the API on a remote server with **Nginx** and **PM2** for process management and crash recovery.

The goal is to provide an API that allows users to **register**, **log in**, **manage their wardrobe**, and **get clothing recommendations** based on the weather.

## üöÄ Deployment Information

- **Frontend Domain**: [https://mywears.crabdance.com](https://mywears.crabdance.com)
- **Backend API Domain**: [https://api.mywears.crabdance.com](https://api.mywears.crabdance.com)

### ‚ö° Crash Test

To simulate a crash and verify PM2 automatically restarts the backend server:

```bash
GET https://api.mywears.crabdance.com/crash-test

    ```
  - The server will intentionally crash.
  - PM2 will automatically restart the server after a crash.
